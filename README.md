# hma-scraper

This is a single python script that scrapes a specified number pages of obfuscated proxy lists at proxylist.hidemyass.com

hma obfuscated the html source with a lot of display:none elements. Never fear, regex is here.

Why?

Excellent for when grey_harvest and tor dont provide enough IP addresses. 107 pages (current number of listed pages) is currently giving 5314 proxies.

Storage format is full url, intended for instant curl -x usage

ex:

https://192.168.1.22:8080
socks5h://196.168.2.43:10000
http://192.168.3.23:8080
Requires:

python 2.7+ or python3

Modules used:

re, requests, print_function, sys

Install/Usage:

$ git clone https://github.com/skyforstle1989/hma-scraper
